## Implement the ES6 fetch API

You'd like to show people what you can do, so to really impress them you're going to display the weather on your About page.

You will use the [OpenWeather API](http://openweathermap.org/current) to fetch the weather from a certain zip code and update the home page to reflect the current weather.
- Here is the [documentation for the weather API](http://openweathermap.org/current).
- If you'd like, you can read about `fetch` in general on MDN [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch).

At the end of this exercise, your solution will look something like this:

### Requirements

On your "About" page, ask the user to input a zip code.
- You can also learn about forms [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html).
	- When this event fires, take the `event.target.value` and `fetch()` from the OpenWeather API.


- Use the response to display the current temperature, the high and low temperate, the current weather description, and the name of the city that came back from the API.
	- Note: Our solution uses Fahrenheit - you're free to use Celsius if you'd like.


**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Because the OpenWeather API is not an open API, every request must end with this API key:  `&appid=052f26926ae9784c2d677ca7bc5dec98`  (i.e. this is a URL you might send a `fetch()` request to: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=60614,us&appid=052f26926ae9784c2d677ca7bc5dec98`).

**Hint 1:** You'll only need to re-work the About component. Nothing else needs to change.

### Optional:

- Spend a little time styling the page. Here's some inspiration (Don't worry about the lens flare!)
